# Car-Trial-Customizer

A vehicle customization tool which I plan to use in future projects this works as a small experiement to learn about using the Observer code Pattern and Scriptable Objects.

## Currently: 
  Using an event system to help reduce dependancies
  - Customization of vehicles so the user can create as many as they want.
    - changing the vehicles body and paint job to change the stats.
